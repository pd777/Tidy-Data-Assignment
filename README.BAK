Assignment to Create Tidy Data Set from Samsung Galaxy

This document contains the overview and instructions for constructing the tidy data set

## Overview of the Data Merging, Cleaning and Aggregation  

### Source Data Tables
The program run_analysis.R assumes that the user will have a foder titled "UCI HAR Dataset"
in their current working directory.  If that directory is not present but the zip file 
"getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip" is in the current working directory, the program will 
unzip this file and create the subdirectories test and train.  

The data chosen for analysis comes from the following files,

*From the UCI HAR folder
features.txt  - this contains the full list of variable names in the test and train set from which the means
will be calculated.    

*From the test subdirectory
subject_text.txt - this contains the subject IDs
X_test.txt - this contains the full set of summarised test subject observations, assumed to be in the same order
Y_text.txt - this contains the activity codes (1-6) for each test subject, also asumed to be in the same order
                                                                              
*From the train  subdirectory
subject_text.txt - this contains the subject IDs
X_train .txt - this contains the full set of summarised train  subject observations, assumed to be in the same order
Y_text.txt - this contains the activity codes (1-6) for each train  subject, also asumed to be in the same.

Because the more detailed information in the inertial signals folder is summarised in the test and train files, 
this data is not incorporated into the construction of the tidy data set.
